# CODSOFT-Intern

Welcome to the repository showcasing my journey through the Data Science Internship at Codsoft! This was a great exposure to my interest in Data Science, where I deepened my understanding of Machine Learning and it's algorithms.

Throughout this journey, I worked on five hands-on projects that challenged me to solve real-world problems using data-driven techniques. This repository contains detailed documentation, code, and insights from each of these projects.
